## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 📊 [Pakistan Elections Analysis (1970–2024)](https://github.com/Hayyankhan2/pakistan-elections-analysis)
Analyzed 24,585 constituency records spanning 54 years, implementing median imputation to clean demographic indicators. Developed OLS Regression models identifying literacy rate as a significant predictor (p < 0.001) of voter turnout. Predicted voter turnout and swing constituencies.

### 🕸️ [Graph Data Science: Author Domain Classification](https://github.com/Hayyankhan2/graph-author-classification)
Constructed a graph of 38,900+ nodes using Louvain Community Detection and FastRP embeddings. Trained a Random Forest classifier achieving a 0.88 F1-Score in domain prediction and a Link Prediction pipeline with 0.95+ confidence.

### 🚗 [UniRide – Full-Stack Carpooling Application](https://github.com/Hayyankhan2/uniride-carpooling)
Architected a scalable platform using .NET/React with role-based auth and a normalized 7-table database. Implemented Web Sockets for real-time ride tracking and dynamic dashboard loading.
